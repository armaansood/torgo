# torgo
An anonymous overlay network based on the <a href="https://svn-archive.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf">Tor</a> protocol. It works by routing traffic from a browser through a randomized circuit of Tor routers before sending it to the web server. Other Tor routers are found using a peer discovery registration service. It can run (for multiple days or longer) in a heterogeneous environment without resource leaks or deadlock. For educational purposes.
